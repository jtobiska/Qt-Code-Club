Instructions
------------

Each member of Qt Code Club should create a directory with their username under
the top-level members/ directory.  This directory is your personal work space
and can be organized however you see fit.  However, we recommend creating a
python/ directory immediately under your username directory (if you're using
python), as your primary python path.

    Example: members/thebeeland/python

Instructions for each month's project will be posted to the Qt-Code-Club wiki,
which can be found at https://github.com/jtobiska/Qt-Code-Club/wiki.

To submit a solution to the monthly project, simply commit a single executable
file into the top-level bin directory.  Solutions should be named using the
following convention:

    bin/${project}_${username}

Solution executables are free to use libraries from user work spaces, but they
should be able to be run without requiring any special setup.  We recommend 
manipulating sys.path within your executable in order to load modules from your
work space.
